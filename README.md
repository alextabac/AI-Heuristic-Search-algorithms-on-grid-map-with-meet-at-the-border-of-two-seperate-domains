# Heuristic-grid-map-search-meet-at-the-border-of-two-graphs
A program to implement and test-run heuristic search algorithms on a grid map or two maps that meet at a border.
This program main purpose is to composite one big map out of 2 maps (or out of 16 maps).
Code:  JAVA
Map files must be located in a sibling folder named "Maps" ("../Maps").
Output files, CSV format, are saved in the same folder as the main program.


This program has several GUIs for user to select.
This program comes with everything needed to run, includded more than a few search algorithms with three different heuristics.
The algorithms included are for 2D maps as well as for 3D maps.
The program can run a search for performance mode, and also in animation mode to allow visuality of the search progress.
The program uses only maps from the Moving Ai Lab repository by Nathan R. Sturtevant:  https://www.movingai.com/  .
The program also provides ability to run marathon of multiple search algorithms with different hyper paramters (where apply).
The GUIs:  the first GUI is map selection, if clicked on Marathon button it will open a new GUI for 2D maps marathon where one or more maps can be selected.
